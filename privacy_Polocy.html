                <h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
                <p><strong>Relevant legal bases according to the GDPR:</strong> Below you will find an overview of the
                    legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the
                    provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of
                    residence or domicile. Furthermore, if more specific legal bases are applicable in individual cases,
                    we will inform you about these in the privacy policy.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Performance of a contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit.
                            b) GDPR):</strong> Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the
                        data subject is party or to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into
                        a contract.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR):</strong> Processing is
                        necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third
                        party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and
                        freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany:</strong> In addition to the data protection
                    regulations of the GDPR, national regulations on data protection in Germany apply. This includes in
                    particular the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG
                    contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to
                    object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and
                    transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases including profiling.
                    Furthermore, data protection regulations of the individual federal states may apply.</p>
                <p><strong>Note on GDPR and Swiss DPA:</strong> These data protection notices serve both the information
                    requirements of the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (Swiss DPA) and the General Data Protection
                    Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, please note that due to the broader geographical scope and
                    comprehensibility, the terms of the GDPR are used. In particular, instead of the terms used in the
                    Swiss DPA, such as "processing" of "personal data", "predominant
